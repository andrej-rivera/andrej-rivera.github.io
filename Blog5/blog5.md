## Blog #05 - Creating a Game Prototype
For the past few weeks, I've been creating a game called *A Slime's Small Adventure*. During this creation process, I had many first time experiences as a beginner artist and game designer. Before going into this post, it should stated that I am not an artist (Computer Science major). Prior to this game, I had zero experience with making pixel art and had no idea how to be artistic *at all*. My journey going from programmer to artist is detailed here.

# *A Slime's Small Adventure*
## The General Idea
When starting this project, there was nothing but just me (artist) and my partner (programmer) brainstorming ideas for a fun game. After a few minutes of bouncing back and forth, we eventually settled with a platformer game as those are generally the most straightforward to develop. However, that single genre was all we had. We knew we had to create a game in Unity but we were a little lost. What would our main character look like? What about the environment? So many questions, and the biggest of them all: Would I (a first time artist) even be able to draw the ideas that we have?

It was then that I stumbled upon the amazing idea of making our main character a slime! Formless and easily colored. You may recognize this creature from other games like Dragon Quest or Terraria. With a slime as the main character, I could draw anything and it'd still look like the blob that we know and love. From this single idea, I began drawing and animating. I watched videos from pixel artists and my art evolved rapidly in just a few days.

However, I eventually hit a roadblock which was animating 'realistic' movement for a slime. If you didn't know, slimes are very **very** squishy. Sometimes they're even described as having the properties of both a liquid and a solid. While this is pretty easy to draw as a single photo in pixel art, animating a creature that moves like a liquid is a massive pain.

And so, another incredible idea came down to save the day. What if we made our slime a soft-body object? Rather than animate the slime myself, what if I just have the game engine do it for me? 

## The Crunch (& trimming of ideas)
This single idea of softbodies became a force multiplier for me as an artist. While my programmer focused on getting a rigid object on Unity to become squishy and soft, I could focus my entire attention to everything else art-related. Backgrounds, shading, tilesets, there was so much to do. In fact, there was too much to do. During this crunch time, we had to cut out many ideas that were simply not feasible to do in the time we had.

Here are some of the many ambitious ideas that we cut out:
- Combat (along with the sub-mechanics of:)
  - Enemies
  - Health
- Splitting
  - Multiple Slimes to Control
  - Complex Puzzles
- Different environments
- Dragon Boss?!?!?!!?
- Stealth

After these ideas were trimmed, the development of the game went way smoother. The type of game that we eventually settled on was a Puzzle Platformer game where you control a slime and explore. In terms of art requirements, there wasn't too much. The background, the tileset, and the slime were the main artworks that I focused on. The final results of this artwork is shown below. Compared to when I first started, I'm very proud of the progress that I made.

### Playtesting!!!
At the end of our game development journey, we finished with an alpha build of the game that was actually playable. Despite it's bugs, the game was pretty well-received by the playtesters. The general playtest process for the game was as follows:
1. Game is introduced by designer (no info on mechanics)
2. Player plays the game blind
3. After 5 minutes
4. 4
To go more in-depth, I'll be walking through how two of the playtests went.
