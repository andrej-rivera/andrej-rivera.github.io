# Overview
This entry is dedicated to a Session Report based on one game of Coup. In this session report, a glimpse of the strategies and gameplay that can be experienced in Coup is shown. The exact actions played in the game are recorded so that the same game can be recreated by following the same actions.

## What is Coup?
Coup is a card game that features the mechanics *Bluffing*, *Card Game*, *Deduction*, *Party Game*, and *Political*. In Coup, players each start with two cards (called influence) and two coins. Players are eliminated when they lose all of their cards. Players can lose cards from the following actions: Coup, Assassinate, and Failing a Bluff. When a card is lost, it is revealed face-up.

Shown in the image above, players can use actions that are available to everyone or use card-specific actions. Some cards also have counter-actions that can be used to prevent another player from taking that action. When a player reaches 7 coins, they can use the Coup action which removes a card from another player of their choosing. This cannot be blocked or prevented.

It should be noted that you don't necessarily have to have the card to take the action. Since cards held by players are not shown to others, players can bluff to pretend they have a card they don't have. If a player is called out on their bluff, the accused loses a card of their choosing. If the accuser is wrong, then the accuser loses a card and the accused replaces their card with another from the stack. This creates an interesting dynamic, to call a player out on a bluff, you need to be willing to also lose a card of your own.

# Thoughts
Personally, Coup was a very simple but fun game of deception. The different ways you can bluff and manipulate your opponents are very interesting. If somebody steals your coins with the Guard's Steal action, you can either bluff that you have a card to block the steal or call out that your opponent doesn't have the guard. If you do bluff, then your opponent is forced to either give up or risk their cards to call you out. Almost every action in the game is risky which makes the stakes high for every bluff. Not lying and playing honest in Coup is a severe disadvantage.
