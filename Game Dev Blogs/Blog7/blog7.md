A few days ago, I played Jackbox games with my class. The Jackbox games that we played were Dodo Re Mi, FixyText, and Hypnotorious. It was pretty fun and it really got me wondering: What makes party games, party games? 


### Mechanics
To start with, let's dive into what characteristics all Jackbox games share. Jackbox games are 'mini' games that you generally play with groups of up to 8 people. These games take no more than 30 minutes to complete and are all independent of each other (don't affect each other). 

A mechanic that nearly all Jackbox games have is a points system where the player with the most amount of points at the end of session wins. Many Jackbox games also include a mechanic where other players determine points through voting. The combination of these two mechanics make the game a popularity contest. Whoever can make the most amount of people laugh or whoever has the wittiest response to a question will often get the most votes.

Personally, I believe that it's these two core mechanics that make a Jackbox game a party game. Points are a simple way to see how well you're doing. Letting other players decide the amount of points you get also turns the games into a friendly competition of 'who can appeal to the widest audience?' (who can make everyone laugh?). It allows people to figure out what kind of humor other people enjoy. Would a person rather play it safe to get some laughs or risk being tone-deaf to make everyone laugh? How people play Jackbox provides small insights as to what their personalities could be if you haven't really interacted with them outside of the game.

### Audience
Another important mechanic for Jackbox games that elevate it to a true party game is the addition of the Audience. While the number of players that can participate and respond to prompts in the game is limited, there is a near limitless amount of people that can be in the audience (10,000 max). The people in the audience can't play normally, the only action they can do is vote and give players points. This allows everybody to participate in a Jackbox game if they're isn't enough space. Gaining the majority vote of the audience also gives a lot of points in most Jackbox games so there is some incentive given to players to appeal to the major audience.

### Takeaway
In the end, it's these core mechanics (points, voting, audience) that make games fun to play in a group. These mechanics ensure that Jackbox games are consistently enjoyable even though there are so many of them.
